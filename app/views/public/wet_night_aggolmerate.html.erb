<p>When it comes to wet night visibility, our Agglomerate Structured Marking is the answer. The <a href="/products/plastiroute-mma-cold-plastic">Plastiroute MMA Cold Plastic</a> that is applied in a reproducible structured pattern allows water to flow in and between the line. This ensures maximum visibility during the day or night, in either wet or dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Advantages</h2>

<p>Agglomerate Structured Markings give excellent wet night visibility to assist traffic control in the reduction of accidents on the roads. This will greatly contribute to the safety of all road users.</p>

<p>The use of this technique offers bead protection from snow plow activities, lengthening the reflective capability of the line.</p>

<p>This marking has freeze/thaw adhesion properties.</p>

<p>We have made modifications to our long line MMA durable truck in order to install the agglomerate on roadways in the safest manner possible to ensure employee safety.</p>
